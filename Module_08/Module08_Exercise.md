**Exercise**

A women-only gym network decided to conduct a study to assess the influence of physical exercise performed by pregnant women on the weight of their babies.

The objective is to evaluate whether changes are needed in the format of the exercises offered in sessions for expectant mothers.

**Understanding the Problem**

- How often do pregnant women typically exercise?  
- Does the level of exercise influence the baby's weight?  
- What are the most common weights for the babies?  

I collected data from the gym: there are 500 registered pregnant women. I gathered information from 50 of them, and the image below shows data from the first 16 women.

**Question 1** What is the population? 
**Answer:** The population includes all pregnant women attending the gym network, which totals 500 women.

**Question 2** What is the sample? 
**Answer:**he sample consists of the 50 pregnant women whose data were collected.

**Question 3** What is the data source (Primary or Secondary)?
**Answer:**The source is *Primary* (since I personally collected the data).

**Question 4** How many observations and variables are there?  
**Answer:** There are 50 observations and 2 variables.

**Question 5** What are the types of variables? 
**Answer:**
- The "Exercise Level" variable is *Qualitative Ordinal*.  
- The "Weight" variable is *Quantitative Continuous*.

**Question 6** Do these data help answer the questions, or do we need more data?  
**Answer:** No, these data are insufficient. We need more information about the pregnant women, as these two variables alone are not enough.

**Solution to the Exercise**

Simply visualizing data, even if it contains all the information, often does not reveal much.

Just looking at the data does not provide a clear picture of what might be happening, especially when the data volume is large.

This is where we can teach algorithms to analyze it for us. This marks the beginning of Machine Learning.

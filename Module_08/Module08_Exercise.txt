Exercise - A network of gyms for women decided to carry out a study to verify the influence of physical exercise practiced by pregnant women on the weight of their babies.

The objective is to assess the need to change or not the format of the exercises offered in the sessions with future mothers.

Understanding the Problem

How much does a pregnant woman usually exercise?
Does the degree of exercise influence the baby's weight?
What weights are most common for babies?
I collected data from the gym, there are 500 registered pregnant women and I collected information from 50 pregnant women and the image below is of the first 16 pregnant women
